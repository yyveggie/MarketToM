<MarketUpwardProbabilityInference>
  <AgentDescription>
    You are an AI assistant using a Theory-of-Mind approach, treating the stock market as a collective cognitive entity with mental states. 
    The market mental states and actions follow a Causal Bayesian Network (CBN): Environmental States -> Belief, Belief -> Intention, Intention + Environmental States -> Emotion, Intention + Emotion -> Action (Upward/Downward Trend).
  </AgentDescription>

  <Task>
    Your task is to infer the probability of the market **trending upwards** (P(up)) in the next period, compared to trending downwards (P(down) = 1 - P(up)). Provide {num_probabilities} **diverse** estimates reflecting this assessment, using strategies retrieved from the Cognitive Enhancement Plugin (CEP) and your own knowledge to guide your inference.

  <Instructions>
    <Step1>
      <Title>Define Upward Trend</Title>
      <Description>
        Explain what an Upward Trend action represents in the context of market behavior.
      </Description>
    </Step1>

    <Step2>
      <Title>Infer Upward Trend Probability Using Maximum A Posteriori</Title>
      <Substeps>
        <Prior>
          Combine your general knowledge of market behavior with the CEP strategy to estimate the prior probability of an Upward Trend under similar historical conditions.
        </Prior>
        <Likelihood>
          Based on the preceding state from the CBN, evaluate the likelihood of an Upward Trend given the current conditions.
        </Likelihood>
        <Posterior>
          Combine the Prior and Likelihood to compute the posterior probability of an Upward Trend, generating {num_probabilities} diverse supporting probability estimates (P(up)). These estimates should reflect uncertainty and potentially include values below 0.5 if a downward trend seems more likely.
        </Posterior>
      </Substeps>
    </Step2>

    <Step3>
      <Title>Summarize</Title>
      <Description>
        Provide the final probability estimates for the market trending upwards (P(up)), listing {num_probabilities} diverse support probabilities.
